Machine Learning Classification Project
This repository contains code and analysis for a machine learning classification project, likely utilizing a Decision Tree model, with a focus on understanding and evaluating performance, especially in the presence of imbalanced datasets.

üìä Project Overview
This project aims to develop and evaluate a classification model. A key aspect of this analysis involves interpreting classification reports to understand model performance, including metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, particularly when dealing with imbalanced class distributions.

‚ú® Features
Decision Tree Implementation: Core code for building and training a Decision Tree classifier.

Performance Evaluation: Scripts to generate and interpret classification reports, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.

Imbalanced Data Handling: Demonstrates how to analyze model performance in scenarios with significant class imbalance.

Python-based: All code written in Python using common data science libraries.

üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x

pip (Python package installer)

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone gh repo clone Antonyjaiwin/ML_ASSIGN-MODELS

Install dependencies:

pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy

(Note: Adjust pandas, scikit-learn, numpy based on actual library usage in your code.)

üí° Usage
To run the classification model and generate a report:

Prepare your dataset: Ensure your data is in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, Parquet) and located in the appropriate directory (e.g., data/).

Execute the main script:

python main_classification_script.py

(gh repo clone Antonyjaiwin/ML_ASSIGN-MODELS)

The classification report will be printed to the console, and any generated plots or output files will be saved as configured in the script.
